## Sorting Algorithms Cheat Sheet

### Basic Sorting Algorithms
- [x] **(Bubble Sort):** Swaps neighbors until everything is sorted. (swap at each comparison) 
- [x] **(Insertion Sort):** Inserts each stone into its right place as she goes.  (swap at each comparison) 
- [x] **(Selection Sort):** Selects the smallest stone and places it at the front.  (swap after each loop)
