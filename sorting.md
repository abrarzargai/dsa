## Sorting Algorithms Cheat Sheet

### Basic Sorting Algorithms
- **Bubba (Bubble Sort):** Swaps neighbors until everything is sorted. (swap at each comparison) 
- **Ines (Insertion Sort):** Inserts each stone into its right place as she goes.  (swap at each comparison) 
- **Sele (Selection Sort):** Selects the smallest stone and places it at the front.  (swap after each loop) 


### Efficient Sorting Algorithms
- **Merge Sort**
- **Quick Sort**
- **Heap Sort**

### Advanced Sorting Algorithms
- **Counting Sort**
- **Radix Sort**
- **Bucket Sort**
