# Common Searching Algorithms

## 1. Linear Search
- [x] **Linear Search**: Looks at each item one by one. Use for small or unsorted lists. || Simple and straightforward.

## 2. Binary Search
- [x] **Binary Search**: Cuts the list in half to find a target (only on sorted lists). Use for large sorted lists. || Fast and efficient.
      
## 3. Jump Search
- [x] **Jump Search**: Jumps ahead by steps and checks each block. Use for sorted lists with predictable patterns. || Good for large data.

## 4. Exponential Search
- [x] **Exponential Search**: Finds the range and then uses binary search. Use for large or infinite lists. || Effective for unknown sizes.

## 5. Interpolation Search
- [x] **Interpolation Search**: Guesses where the target might be based on value. Use for uniformly distributed sorted lists. || Best when values are evenly spread.

## 6. Ternary Search
- [x] **Ternary Search**: Divides the list into three parts instead of two. Use when you want fewer comparisons. || More efficient for specific cases.

## 7. Fibonacci Search
- [x] **Fibonacci Search**: Uses Fibonacci numbers to split the list. Use for sorted lists to avoid divisions. || Useful for specialized scenarios.

## 8. Rabin-Karp Algorithm
- [x] **Rabin-Karp Algorithm**: Searches for a
