# Common Searching Algorithms

- [x] **Linear Search**: Looks at each item one by one. Use for small or unsorted lists. || Simple and straightforward.
- [x] **Binary Search**: Cuts the list in half to find a target (only on sorted lists). Use for large sorted lists. || Fast and efficient.
- [ ] **Jump Search**: Jumps ahead by steps and checks each block. Use for sorted lists with predictable patterns. || Good for large data.
- [ ] **Exponential Search**: Finds the range and then uses binary search. Use for large or infinite lists. || Effective for unknown sizes.
- [ ] **Interpolation Search**: Guesses where the target might be based on value. Use for uniformly distributed sorted lists. || Best when values are evenly spread.
- [ ] **Ternary Search**: Divides the list into three parts instead of two. Use when you want fewer comparisons. || More efficient for specific cases.
- [ ] **Fibonacci Search**: Uses Fibonacci numbers to split the list. Use for sorted lists to avoid divisions. || Useful for specialized scenarios.
- [ ] **Rabin-Karp Algorithm**: Searches for a
